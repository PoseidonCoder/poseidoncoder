## 👨‍💻 full-stack teen nerd and open source enthusiast

***I'm currently working on*** a lot of different things. One of the most notable of them is Heron, a *powerful CSS preprossessor*. I've worked on it a lot but I still have no pull requests 😕.

## 🥅 goals for 2021

* contribute to more open-source projects
* learn a new programming language
* get my homework done early 😅
